    <h2>About Our Game</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of this capstone project is to create a web application
      that allows people interested in computer science to explore various career pathways
      in a way that is encouraging and engaging. There is a major disparity between genders 
      and races in the field of computer science, and this can be accredited to the fact that 
      there is an existing stereotype of who a person in the field is. 
      This web application demonstrates how there is a place in computer science for everyone,
      therefore dismantling this monolithic idea of who a computer scientist is and what someone with a computing related degree can do. 
      This web application is designed to serve students who are less exposed to the field of computer science, 
      or may believe that they are not right for the field. Most high schools donâ€™t provide an extensive computer science curriculum, 
      so this web application will provide information on the various career paths available to a person in the field.
